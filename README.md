# TensorFlow-FaceVerification
Design and development of Face verification using TensorFlow Deep learning framework
Design and Development of Face verification using TensorFlow Deep learning framework. To train the model in a way it should be able to calculate the features of any person image given outside the training data and compare the features of an already present image with the real-time image and perform image verification. With this research, we can perform clustering of images, removal of noise and aadhar/ID verification.
